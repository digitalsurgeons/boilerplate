Purpose: Make things move in awesome ways.

I cherry picked from Geoff Graham's Animate.scss library
which was derived by Den Eden's Animate.css. Each are using
MIT Licenses that allow us to use, reuse, repackage, modify,
and profit with no issues.

CSS Transitions
Inside 'animations/_properties.scss' are all the variables
for Robert Penner's easing formulas: Sine, Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint,
Expo, Circ, and Back. They all have ease, easeIn, and easeOut varieties.
Each changes how animation feels. You can use them in your
own transitions. Syntax: ease<In/Out><Formula>

.nifty-element {
  @include transition(opacity .5s $easeOutQuad);
  opacity: 0;
}
.nifty-element:hover {
  opacity: 1;
}

CSS3 Animations with @keyframes
Also inside 'animations/_properties.scss' is the core of what makes this library great.
An @keyframes generator with an easy to use way of building swanky animations
like elastic, bounce and zoom.

.nifty-element:hover {
  @include zoomIn();
}

Avaiable to you are: fadeIn(), fadeOut(), slideIn(), slideOut(), zoomIn(), zoomOut(),
bounce(), flash(), pulse(), shake(), and wobble(). Some have modifiers to change the direction
they move as they come in, or as they go out. /ui.html has more info.


Customize Global Feel
Having animations are great, but what makes a site “feel” premium is a consistent feel of our page’s animations. To do this, modify the ds-boilerplate _settings.scss $animation-feel property. All animation mixins that contain variants matching your $animation-feel will be included instead.


Feel options: "confident", "bouncy", "strong", "selective", "lazy"

---

Individual animations can over-ride the global $animation-feel variable by passing one of the
feel options to the mixin as an argument.

.nifty-element:hover {
  @include slideIn("bouncy");
}


Amplifying the Feeling
All feel options can have their effect exaggerated or limited by prepending an "urgency modifier".
Available modifiers are "more-" and "less-".

.nifty-element:hover {
  @include slideIn("less-bouncy");
}
